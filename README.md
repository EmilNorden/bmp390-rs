# Rust BMP390 driver

**This driver is still under development and is not feature-complete.**

This crate provides a platform-agnostic async driver for the Bosch BMP390 pressure (and temperature!) sensor using the [`embedded-hal-async`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.

The BMP390 driver supports both I2C and SPI communication, and this driver does as well.

### Highlighted features

- `no_std` + `embedded-hal-async` support
- I²C and SPI support
- Ergonomic high-level API (no register twiddling needed, unless you want to)
- Strongly-typed register access via `read::<regs::...>()` / `write::<regs::...>()` for those who cant stay away.
- FIFO support.

### Roadmap
- DRDY/Interrupt support
- Stabilize the public API (typestate vs. ergonomic helpers).
- Add blocking API (embedded-hal) alongside async.
- Increasing developer ergonomics.
- Documentation.

# Device
The Bosch BMP390 is a pressure sensor with an accuracy of ±3 Pascal, equivalent to 0.25m altitude.

#### [Datasheet](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bmp390-ds002.pdf)

# Usage

Add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bmp390-rs = "0.2"
```

The driver is initialized by creating an instance of the `Bmp390` struct. Use `Bmp390::new_i2c` to create a driver that uses I2C, or `Bmp390::new_spi` for SPI.

When creating the driver, you need to pass an `Configuration` instance that specifies how the data should be sampled. If you don't care and want sane defaults, you can always use
`Configuration::default()` OR `Configuration::from_preset(..)` for a configuration that matches the presets that Bosch includes in the datasheet.
# Examples
This example shows how to continuously read pressure and temperature data from the driver.
```rust
use bmp390_rs::Bmp390;
use bmp390_rs::config::Configuration;

async fn main() {

    let peripherals = get_peripherals();

    let i2c = init_i2c(); // Initialize async I2C

    let mut bmp = Bmp390::new_i2c(
        i2c,
        0x77,
        Configuration::default(),
        &mut Delay{})
        .await
        .unwrap();

    loop {
        let reading = bmp.read_sensor_data()
            .await
            .unwrap();
        println!("Pressure: {:?} temp: {:?}", reading.pressure, reading.temperature);
    }
}
```
